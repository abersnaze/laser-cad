# CAD for laser cutters

## Primary Goals

To make a tool for sharing a laser cutter amoung a school of kids.

## Current Features

* taylored to macOs track pads.
* cutting and etching settings without cumbersom mappings
* constraints (size, accuracy, and precision) of the printer preprogrammed
* material size doesn't have to match printer bed size.

## Future Plans

* hosted via RaspberryPi attached directly to printer.
* integrated rastor to vector converter
* non rectangular material. (pint glasses)
* job compaction to make use of material on the printer bed
